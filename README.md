## Running in Docker

1. Setup X Server so docker has gui access if you want

Mac: XQuartz Example: https://gist.github.com/sorny/969fe55d85c9b0035b0109a31cbcb088
Windows: VcXsrv

1. `make build-bot`

1. `make run-bot`

## Building your first script

###### Setting up the environment
It is a personal recommendation that you attempt to clone this repository using **IntelliJ**

This is so the intended template present is loaded as it was created.

Doing so will allow the run configurations to be prepared for you to simply run the script effortlessly.

###### Making Changes
The project uses Gradle to handle dependencies, so if you're interested in adding a new library to your script then
simply add it in whatever manner that library recommends.

#### API Reference
To explore the methods you can use in your script check out the API References here:

[OsrsBot API Reference](https://osrsb.github.io/OsrsBot/)

One for the DaxWalkerRSB API will be added later.

By default, the project will come with [RuneLite](https://github.com/RuneLite), [OsrsBot](https://github.com/OSRSB/OsrsBot),
and [DaxWalkerRSB](https://github.com/OSRSB/DaxWalkerRSB) already listed as imports for use.

The script in the example is a basic cannonball making script to outline general script making practices and capabilities.
An advanced script maker can go far beyond this adding their own dependencies, functionalities,
utilizing the WebWalker (DaxWalkerRSB), and even go as far as edit the underlying API if they see the need to.
After all, it is open source.

###### Testing your script
###### *To Run*
To run your script it is as easy as hitting the green play button in **Intellij**

###### *Debugging*
You can use the debugging features present in both **IntelliJ** (the bug button beside the play button)
and utilize some ones present in both
[OsrsBot](https://github.com/OSRSB/OsrsBot) and [RuneLite](https://github.com/RuneLite)
to diagnose any unwanted behavior.
In the future the API will support being launched using an RSPS client for quick testing scripts.

###### *Why is it so easy?*
The reason this works so simply is due to Gradle run tasks being configured to enable accessing
[OsrsBot](https://github.com/OSRSB/OsrsBot) 's main method without IntelliJ throwing an error.
Since we have the project set-up to already have settings configured script-template[launchClientWithScript].
If not just select that one to launch.



###### Deploying your script
Using **IntelliJ** you should find that compiling your script is rather simple.
In **IntelliJ** build outputs are referred to as **Artifacts**.

**IMPORTANT**

When you go to create an artifact ensure that ONLY the compiled source is selected as output
UNLESS you imported an external dependency that wouldn't be used in OsrsBot, DaxWalkerRSB, or
RuneLite

Instructions:

To set up an artifact that outputs as a jar (the format one would use in the OsrsBot.jar) simply hit:
1. File
2. Project Structure
3. Artifacts
4. The plus sign in the center column
5. Jar
6. Empty
7. From Available Elements Open the drop-down for Script_Template
8. From that drop-down open the one for Main
9. Double-click 'Script_Template.main' compiled output
10. Click Ok
11. Click Apply (in the Project Structure interface)
12. Click Ok (in the same interface as above)
13. Profit!

Now you have a script you can use in the OsrsBot.jar OR you can continue to run and test within your build environment.
It is up to you.


To use a script for OsrsBot, traverse to the following location and place the .jar:

**Windows:** C:\\Users\\[username]\\OsrsBot\\Scripts\\Precompiled \
**Linux:** /home/[username]/.config/OsrsBot/Scripts/Precompiled \
**MacOS:** /Users/[username]/Library/Application Support/OsrsBot/Scripts/Precompiled

Now you're ready to script.

### Docker
The script-template additionally includes a Dockerfile to aid in building containers. The Dockerfile itself is fairly
simple and anyone experienced with Docker should find this all very easy to use. That said it isn't necessary for general
script builders to be utilizing containerization, but decent reasons include wanting to keep the bot files separate from
your actual PC. (Currently the builds target your PC, but execution will occur on the container).
That said there are Gradle tasks for easier Docker building, but some essential instructions are needed first.

##### Install Docker:
https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

##### Install IntelliJ Docker plugin

##### XServer
For Windows I personally use:
https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/
While untested for Nix and Mac, they have much easier routes

##### Build Docker:
docker build -t bot-image .

##### Run Docker:

This will remove the container every time you run it (Fresh container)

```docker run -e DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0 -t --rm bot-image```

Without removing the container

```docker run -e DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0 -t bot-image```
Or without docker.host:internal

```docker run -e DISPLAY="$(ip -o route get to 8.8.8.8 | sed -n 's/.*src \([0-9.]\+\).*/\1/p'):0.0" --rm -t bot-image```

Open Terminal in IntelliJ:
Alt+F12 (Windows)

To connect to a running container with Bash open the terminal in Intellij (or wherever) and then run the following

```
docker container ls
```

Note the name for the container (unless you want to copy the id)
Then with that name run

```
docker container exec -it {container-name} bash
```
